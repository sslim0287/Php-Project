   <h2>Our Campuses</h2>
   <h2>KDU Penang University College</h2>
    <ul>
     <br><a>Spurred by the success of the Petaling Jaya campus, 
	 the KDU board decided to expend the college beyond the 
	 Damansara Jaya vicinity and plans were quickly made to 
	 make this dream a reality. From there, a decision was 
	 made to set up a branch campus in Penang with the aim to 
	 provide further education access to Penangites as well as 
	 the community in Northern Malaysia.</a><br>

	 <br><a>KDU Penang University College began its chapter when 
	 it opened its door to its first batch of students in 1991. 
	 Since then, the KDU Penang University College has grown by 
	 leaps and bounds. Now sitting proudly at Jalan Anson, KDU Penang 
	 University College is the most popular private tertiary education 
	 provider in the northern region. It has international alumni from 
	 60 countries around the world.</a><br>

	 <br><a>KDU Penang University College’s range of internationally 
	 recognised industry-driven academic programmes covers a wide level of 
	 offerings from Certificate to Diploma and Degree level programmes. 
	 All its programmes are accredited by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency 
	 and are internationally affiliated with top universities around the globe 
	 such as University of Lincoln and Northumbria University from the United Kingdom 
	 and the International Management Institute Switzerland (IMI).</a><br>

	 <br><a>KDU Penang was conferred an all-round 6-star College status by Ministry of 
	 Higher Education (MOHE) MyQuest Audit 2014/2015. It boasts of state-of-the-art 
	 facilities which include industry-standard 5 star kitchens, a Recording Studio, 
	 Media Command Centre, Art Gallery and Design Studios, VLSI engineering labs, Games 
	 and Multimedia Computing Design Labs, Business Boardrooms and Lounge, Mock Hotel Suites, 
	 Mixology lab and many more.</a><br>

	 <br><a>In 2015, KDU Penang received the prestigious 6-star, college-based rating in the 
	 2014/2015 Malaysian MyQUEST for the large category. KDU College was the only private college 
	 in Penang – and the Northern region – to be awarded this eminent recognition.</a><br>
	 
	 <br><a>All this helps ensure that every KDU student is well prepared to be gainfully employed 
	 upon graduation – an indisputable fact that has strengthened the institution’s impressive graduate 
	 employment ratio record.</a><br>

	 <br><a>Over a span of 25 years, our students continue to do us proud with a string of successes in 
	 various national and international competitions. In July 2013, KDU Penang was also awarded the Penang MPSP 
	 Green Industry Award for the SME Education and Awareness category. For a real education in the real world – 
	 HIT THE GROUD RUNNING™ with KDU Penang University College.</a><br>

   <h2>METROPOLIS AT BATU KAWAN</h2>
    <ul>
     <br><a>In 2014, Paramount Corporation Berhad inked a deal with Penang Development Corporation (PDC) to purchase 
	 30 acres of freehold land in Batu Kawan, Penang. Located 5 minutes to the Second Penang Bridge at Bandar Cassia, 
	 the newest and largest township on the mainland of Penang state, comprises 10 acres of institutional land and 
	 20 acres of land for integrated development.</a><br>

	 <br><a>The signing will see PCB build Penang’s first university metropolis in the fast-growing district of Batu Kawan. The 
	 metropolis will be developed by Paramount Property, the property development arm of PCB, and will be anchored by a 
	 new purpose-built campus for KDU Penang, owned by PCB’s Paramount Education group.</a><br>

	 <br><a>Under the terms of the agreement, PCB acquired the land from PDC at RM65,557,800 with the institutional land transacted 
	 at RM40.50/sq ft, while the land for development transacted at RM55/sq ft, both with freehold titles.</a><br>

	 <br><a>The new KDU campus in Batu Kawan would feature facilities that are more in line with the requirements of a university college, 
	 with a comprehensive range of academic, sports and recreational facilities, creating a live-and-learn, work-and-play environment that 
	 stimulates and promotes learning.</a><br>
	 
	 <br><a>By having a campus at Batu Kawan, which is also home to the planned Batu Kawan Industrial Park, KDU Penang University College 
	 would also be able to collaborate with employers to provide students with more opportunities to undertake internships and participate 
	 in professional activities. Similarly, the staff of KDU Penang will be able to collaborate with the manufacturing and commercial 
	 industries nearby to carry out joint research projects, which will bring tremendous benefits to the university college in the long run.
	 </a><br>

	 <br><a>Programmes will be work-integrated and community-integrated to prepare job-ready graduates, and will also incorporate sustainability 
	 issues as a component of their curricula.</a><br>
	 
	 <br><a>In terms of property development, this new university metropolis in Batu Kawan would become the new property magnet to meet the needs 
	 of Penang’s growing and maturing population, especially given its position as the 3rd satellite town in Penang, after Bayan Lepas and Seberang 
	 Jaya, and the state’s main industrial site on the mainland.</a><br>
